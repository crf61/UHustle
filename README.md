# UHustle
This is Christy Felix's python project.

# What is this?
This program is a search engine for students looking to purchase items and services from other students on college campuses.
This is an extension of UHustle's website, theuhustle.com. UHustle is an online marketplace for students who provide goods and services.

# How does it work?
This program is meant for students looking for an item or service at their school or at nearby schools.
In order for the program to tell you what items are available. The user (you) needs to tell the program your name, your school, and the category you're looking for.

# What schools are available?
The schools you can choose from are Georgetown University, George Washington University, and American University

# What categories are available?
So far, hustlers only posted listings in these available categories: Food/Drink, Entertainment, Media, and Beauty.

# Notes
Please note not all schools have the same listings. Sometimes you won't be able to find what you want at Georgetown but may find what you're looking for at George Washington.
