# UHustle
This is Christy Felix's 2020 python project.

# Why is this important?
This program is a search engine for students looking to purchase items and services from other students on college campuses.
It makes it easier for students to purchase from other students and for customers to easier find what they are looking for.
This is an extension of UHustle's website, theuhustle.com. UHustle is an online marketplace for students who provide goods and services.

# Program Description
